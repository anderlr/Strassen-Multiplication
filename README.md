# Strassen-Multiplication

### **Matrix Multiplication and Pixels- Strassen**
---

**Goal**: Apply a filter to a desired image file using matrix multiplication with a reasonable 
complexity using Strassen's matrix multiplication method. The output can then be converted
to any image file so that the result can be verified visually.

This algorithm only works for PPM Format Images (P3 compression)

In order to convert an image from PNG,JPEG (or any other format) to the desired one you can use the ImageMagick tool:


  * Linux: It can be obtained via the simple command:
  ```
  $ wget https://www.imagemagick.org/download/ImageMagick.tar.gz
  ```
  * Windows: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

 **Note**: There are two versions for this algorithm, one that takes input from the command line and one from a .ppm file and prints the result in a .ppm file as well.
